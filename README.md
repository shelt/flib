# Flib
### Functional game library

A high-level game library written in Scheme.

## Requirements

The sdl2 egg requires Simple DirectMedia Layer version 2.0.0 or higher. It will not work with older versions of SDL.

This egg requires CHICKEN Scheme 4.8 or higher. Please file an issue or contact the maintainer if you need to use this library with an earlier version of CHICKEN Scheme.

The unit tests depend on the test egg, and many demos and examples depend on the miscmacros egg. Some demos and examples have other dependencies as well.

## Tasks
- Map generation
- Map element (with path as parameter)
- Game GUI
